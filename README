Call Tracking Metrics PHP Library
---------------------------------

Requires: PHP 5.x

To use server side tracking script for Call Tracking Metrics, you will need to install the two php files.

    ctm_numbers.php
    ctm_config.php

ctm_config.php must be callable via an HTTP Request.
We recommend the use of a valid SSL cert to protect all communication between our servers and your server.

e.g.

    https://example.com/ctm_config.php


Open the ctm_config.php file and update the 2 security tokens

    //define("CTM_ACCESS_KEY", "");
    //define("CTM_SECRET_KEY", "");

You may need to enable API access in your account by going to "settings" -> "manage settings" page and clicking "Enable API Access"


To have your call tracking metrics account send configuration updates to your server set up an HTTP notification.

Under the "settings" menu click "notifications"

  Choose "After a tracking number change"

  Choose "http"

  Add the location of your ctm_config.php file e.g.
    https://example.com/ctm_config.php

Next to trigger a request to your server and have the configuration file written for the first time, go to the edit screen
for one of your tracking numbers and click "Save Tracking Number".

This will trigger the new notification to send a request to your server.
