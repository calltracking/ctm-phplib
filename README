Call Tracking Metrics PHP Library
---------------------------------

Requires: PHP 5.x

To use server side tracking script for Call Tracking Metrics, you will need to install the two tracking scripts.

  ctm_numbers.php
  ctm_config.php

ctm_config.php must be callable via an HTTP Request. 
We recommend the use of a valid SSL cert to protect all communication between our servers and your server.

e.g.
  
  http://example.com/ctm_config.php


You must configure in Call Tracking Metrics the ctm_config.php endpoint or URL that exposes the ctm_config.php file.
